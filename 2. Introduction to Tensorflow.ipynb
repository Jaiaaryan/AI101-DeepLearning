    "When we add two numbers in python. like a=3, b=5, print(a+b). For this computation to happen it basically requires you to store the content of a and b in a memory location and also store the computation graph created by me. In this example it is (a,+,b). The computer converts it into pre-order (+,a,b) or post order(a,b,+) format for computation.  \n",
